In 2020, almost 89.90% of the world’s population owns a mobile. Mobile subscriptions are increasing everyday as it is accessible to most of the population throughout the world. This analysis gives an in-depth look to see if all countries have a high number of mobile subscriptions or not.


### Data Source 1: [Internet Usage: History of Internet and evolution of Broadband](https://www.kaggle.com/pavan9065/internet-usage)
**Description:** The data consists of the Internet and the Evolution of Broadband around the world. The Data is collected from Our World In Data.


### Data Source 2: [EIU Democracy Indices Dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d0noZrwAWxNBTDSfDgG06_aLGWUz4R6fgDhRaUZbDzE/htmlview)
**Description:** Dataset description: The Democracy Index captures the quality of democracy in just one number. It's calculated by the Economist Intelligence Unit(EIU) on a yearly basis, as a scale from 0 to 10, which Gapminder has converted to a scale form 0 to 100, to make it easier to communicate as a percentage.

**Q) What is the growth of mobile subscriptions in the last decade?** \
Hong Kong has the highest number of mobile subscriptions over the last decade. It can be observed that there is a substantial increase in the number of mobilesubscriptions in the last decade in all the countries. This can be attributed to the increase in population and technological advancements. Among the countries with the least mobile subscriptions, we can see that there is an increase in the number of subscriptions but the growth is less. Venezuela and Dominican Republic are the countries with the least number of mobile subscriptions.\

**Q) How much has the broadband subscription grown in the last decade?**\
The broadband has become an highly integral part of everyone’s life. Various tech companies are emerging each and every day with brilliant ideas that could change the world. Even though we know the importance of broadband, we need to find out if broadband is actually reaching every corner of the world and how much it’s usage has grown in the last decade. 
The internet has been the major source of wealth in the modern world with the arrival of the digital age. So, it is not surprising to see that the richer European countries dominate the list of the top 10 countries where the broadband has risen the most in the last decade along with UAE and China, where the rise in broadband has given rise to various startups in the last decade boosting the country’s economy.\
The bottom 10 countries are some of the poorest african countries which are still to witness the internt boom with the exceptions of Kuwait and Bahrain, both of whom still rely heavily on oil for their economy.\
\
**Q) How is the usage of Broadband and Cellular subscriptions in different regions of the world?**\
It can be observed that broadband is still not very popular in Africa and Oceania with them having only 2.81 and 8.23 subscriptions per 100 people respectively compared to Europe which has 34.4 subscriptions per 100 people. However, when we observe the cellular data across the world, we can conclude that they are more or less almost equal throughout the world with Asia having the most at 128.35 subscriptions per 100 people and Oceania being the least at 75.27 subscriptions per 100 people.\
\
**Q) Identifying link between Democracy Index and Broadband Subscriptions**\
A clear correlation between number of broadband subscriptions and democracy index was observed. In the year 2006, when internet was booming across the world, countries with higher democracy index had a greater number of internet users than the countries with lower democracy indexes. A slow rise, over 15 years, can be seen in the number of broadband subscriptions (per 100 people) in the countries with lower democracy index. However, the countries with higher index have more broadband subscriptions throughout. The correlation coefficient between these two attributes is 0.6535. The value indicates a moderate positive correlation. On examining the correlation coefficient between these two columns in the year 2006 and 2020, it was observed that correlation weakened in the recent years.
